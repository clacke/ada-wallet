paging-jsend-get
================

Generic node that makes GET requests and expects paginated JSend
replies a la Cardano.

It accepts HTTP requests on its `in` port and sends a sequence of
objects on its `out` port. It sends and receives HTTP requests and
data on its `http` in and out ports.

The data coming `in` is a `http-get-request` (POST requests cannot do
paging), and it initially simply forwards that to its `http` out. If
the `http` in port returns an `http-error`, that is simply forwarded
to `out`.

It assumes that an `http-response` coming in on `http` has valid JSON
bytes as its data and that a JSON object with `paging` in `metadata`
will have an array in `data`.

For each object in the `data` array, it send the parsed object to its
`out` as a JSExpr (lists, numbers, strings, hashes with symbol keys).

If the metadata indicates that there are more pages, it requests the
next page and stars over. When there are no more objects, it sends an
eof to `out`.
